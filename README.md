# Evaluation
This branch contains the resources used to evaluate and compare the performances of the algorithms under analysis.

The script `evaluate.py` generates all the required plots in `/plots`, by reading the `.csv` session files in `/logs`.

Here is an example of the set of plots that are generated for a session.

| OrbSLAM2 | OrbSLAM2 vs. OrbSLAM3 | OrbSLAM3 + Cones detection |
| --- | --- | --- |
